# Anime Music Generator
Anime Music Generator is developed using a simple Recurrent Neural Network and deployed to a heroku website using Django. 

Link to the model website: [Anime Music Generator](https://anime-music-generator.herokuapp.com/).

For a single request, the model usually runs about 20-30 seconds to generate a 1-minute song.

Heroku is a bit laggy so the website/the model can be down sometimes.
